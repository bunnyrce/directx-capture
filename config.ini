# DirectX Desktop Duplication Configuration
# //madebybunnyrce - settings for this DirectX capture shit

[capture]
# How often to grab frames (milliseconds) - 200ms is pretty fucking fast
capture_interval=200

# How many frames to grab before stopping (0 = keep going forever)
frame_count=50

# Which monitor to capture (0 = main screen, 1+ = other displays)
adapter_index=0

[network]
# Where to send the captured frames (localhost for testing)
server_ip=127.0.0.1

# TCP port for sending frames - make sure receiver is listening here
server_port=12346

# How long to wait for connection before giving up
timeout=30

[output]
# Save captured frames locally (0=no, 1=yes)
save_local=0

# Local output directory
output_dir=./captures/

# BMP compression (0=none, 1=rle)
compression=0

[detection]
# This section shows what makes this shit detectable (for educational purposes)
# DirectX API calls that get monitored: D3D11CreateDevice, DuplicateOutput, AcquireNextFrame
# Network patterns: consistent TCP traffic sending frame data
# Performance signatures: GPU usage spikes, memory allocation for capture buffers
